## Abstract
As climate change impacts intensify and pose unprecedented threats to communities worldwide, the need for effective climate adaptation policies has never been greater. However, the effectiveness of these policies in reducing climate vulnerability remains poorly understood. This study examines the real-world effects of various climate policies on community vulnerability across New England.

Using a comprehensive dataset of 1,232 policies from the Resilience and Adaptation in New England (RAINE) database and integrating Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) data, a blend of Staggered Treatment Difference-in-Differences (DID) models and Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) Fixed Effects regression models were used to evaluate the impact of policy features, types, and implementation levels. To address multicollinearity among predictors, sets of Principal Components (PCs) for climate policy components were included.

The analysis reveals that policies focusing on infrastructure enhancements and regulatory measures are most effective in reducing vulnerability. In contrast, policies aimed at Social and Environmental Justice, Climate Mitigation, and Disaster Recovery may inadvertently increase vulnerability due to ineffective implementation, neglect of community needs, or negative externalities. Notably, local-level initiatives with state funding demonstrate significant success in enhancing resilience through increased resources.

These findings provide insights into the practical effects of climate policies. For policymakers, the study highlights the need to prioritize infrastructure and regulatory measures to achieve reductions in vulnerability. It also underscores the potential pitfalls of poorly implemented policies in social justice, climate mitigation, and disaster recovery. By aligning policy goals with community-specific outcomes and leveraging state resources for local initiatives, this research offers a roadmap for crafting adaptive strategies that mitigate risks and bolster community resilience against climate change.
